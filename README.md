# 3A's Custom Paronamas (TCP)
A simple resource pack that changes the panorama in-game.

With the removal of the classic dirt background in snapshot 24w09a for 1.20.4, the panorama seen on the game's home screen has become extremely important. Therefore, I've created a few panoramas for different versions, ranging from version 1.13 to 1.20.4 and beyond when they are released.

If the resource pack format changes in a minor version, a new panorama will be released along it.
